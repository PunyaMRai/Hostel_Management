# Hostel_Management 
The Hostel Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate the administrative tasks involved in managing hostel facilities. The system offers two user interfaces — one for administrators and another for students — and supports both boys and girls hostels.

Built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL (via XAMPP), the system allows for efficient room allocation, student record management, and complaint handling, providing a centralized platform for hostel operations.
